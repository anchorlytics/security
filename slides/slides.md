And he said to his disciples, 

“Therefore I tell you, <br>
do not be anxious about your life, <br>

For life is more than food, <br>

Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap,<br>
they have neither storehouse nor barn,<br>
and yet God feeds them.

And which of you by being anxious<br>

Consider the lilies, how they grow:<br>
they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you,<br>
even Solomon in all his glory<br>
was not arrayed like one of these.

[28](# "ref")
But if God so clothes the grass,<br>
which is alive in the field today,<br>
and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,<br>
how much more will he clothe you,<br>
O you of little faith!

[Luke 12:22-34 (ESV) (p.4/6)](# "ref")

[29](# "ref")
And do not seek what you are to eat<br>
and what you are to drink, nor be worried.

and your Father knows that you need them.

[31](# "ref")
Instead, seek his kingdom,<br>
and these things will be added to you.

Provide yourselves with moneybags<br>

with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail,<br>
where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.

For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
