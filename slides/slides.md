+ powerlessness, dependency:
  + 22-23 intro: life/body more than food/clothing
  + 24: birds fed
  + 25-26: hour to life
  + do I trust in own ability to provide? 
+ pursuit, worry
  + 27-28: lilies clothed
  + 29-30: seek / suspense for food/clothing
  + what do I worry about? source of security? 
+ precious, treasure
  + 31-32: the kingdom
  + 33-34: treasure in heaven
  + where is my treasure? What is precious to me? 
+ even the grass: 700-yr pots common in China, your "antiques" are our trash

“Therefore I tell you, <br>
do not be anxious about your life, <br>

Consider the ravens: <br>
they neither sow nor reap,<br>

Consider the lilies, how they grow:

But if God so clothes the grass,
which is alive in the field today,
